# Approximations to the hypergeometric function f21

We started with an ansatz for the frequency evolution
of the merger-ringdown signal.
The integral of this ansatz contained
a hypergeometric function f21,
sometimes called Gaussian or ordinary hypergeometric
function.

This seems to be the most expension part of the model
so would be good to find a way to make this computation
more efficient.
